# WordRun v0.0.04 - Session Summary (2026-01-09)

## Session Type: Emotional Design Research - Psychology of Player Engagement

This session focused on deep research into emotional design principles from Don Norman and Tim Gabe to inform WordRun's design strategy. The goal was to translate academic design theory into practical, actionable implementation patterns specifically tailored for WordRun's typing-based word-puzzle gameplay.

---

## From Dev Director's Notes

### Core Vision & Intent
The dev director's vision for WordRun continues to emphasize:
- **Story-First Integration**: A non-negotiable principle where narrative is infused directly into gameplay, not treated as an add-on
- **Four Pillars of Redevelopment**: Market Research, Story/Lore, Monetization, and Design Excellence
- **Research-Informed Design**: Strategic shift from "make it work" to "make it great" through data-driven decisions
- **Quality Over Speed**: Taking time to design right, then build once with strategic clarity
- **Emotional Engagement**: Creating experiences that make players feel something, not just function well

### Must-Include Features & Updates (Strategic Phase)
Based on emotional design research and market findings:
- **Perfect Typing Microinteractions**: Every keystroke must feel responsive and satisfying (60fps non-negotiable)
- **Epic Chain Completions**: 2-3 second celebration sequences with Ruut animations, confetti, and triumphant sounds
- **Ruut Character Personality**: 3-4 varied celebration animations, expressive idle states, encouraging failure recovery
- **Story Integration Without Interruption**: 3-5 second NPC dialogues (skippable), 30-60 second land transitions (replayable)
- **Streak System with Loss Aversion**: Daily streaks, streak freeze mechanics, milestone celebrations (7, 30, 100, 365 days)
- **Generous Typo Forgiveness**: Visual feedback when typos are forgiven, settings adjustable (1-3 seconds)
- **Juice on Every Interaction**: Buttons scale on press, menus stagger fade-in, power-ups glow, score bars bounce
- **60 FPS Performance**: Typing input <16ms, animations use GSAP/Anime.js, texture atlases, object pooling
- **Ethical Monetization**: Never gate story/progression; monetize convenience (hints, lives) and self-expression (cosmetics)
- **Daily/Weekly Engagement Loops**: Daily challenges, login rewards, streak check-ins, weekly leaderboards, story arc payoffs

### Visual Appeal & User Experience Goals
- **Visceral Design**: Color palettes per land, crisp typography (16-18pt mobile), 2.5D art style, smooth animations (200-400ms)
- **Behavioral Design**: Instant feedback (<100ms), clear success/error states, generous typo system, sense of control
- **Reflective Design**: Player identity through customization, story-driven progression, lasting memories, social pride
- **Emotional Core**: Accomplishment + Curiosity + Calm Confidence + Delight
- **Norman's Three Levels**: All emotional design must address visceral (first impression), behavioral (usability), and reflective (meaning) layers

### 2. Key Design Principles Established

#### Norman's Three Levels Applied to WordRun

**Visceral Level (First Impression):**
- **Color Strategy**: Each land has distinct emotional palette (early = warm/welcoming, mid = saturated/exciting, late = sophisticated)
- **Typography**: Clean sans-serif for chains (readability critical), character-ful font for story/dialogue
- **Animation Philosophy**: "Juice" on every interaction (200-400ms sweet spot)
- **Ruut Character Design**: 2.5D style, instantly likeable, expressive

**Behavioral Level (Using It):**
- **Typing Optimization**: <16ms input lag, instant feedback on each keystroke, generous typo forgiveness (1-3 seconds adjustable)
- **Performance Targets**: 60fps constant during typing, 30fps minimum during heavy animations
- **Feedback Loops**: Correct word = 500-600ms celebration; Wrong word = 400ms recovery (faster than success)
- **Sense of Control**: Commands discoverable, penalty box transparent, ads always optional

**Reflective Level (Meaning):**
- **Identity Expression**: Player naming, Ruut customization, profile stats, titles/badges
- **Storytelling**: Light touch (1-2 sentences) → Medium touch (short cutscenes) → Rich narrative (late game)
- **Memory Creation**: Streak system, shareable results (Wordle-style), seasonal events, photo mode
- **Social Connection**: Leaderboards, guilds/clubs, friend challenges, social gifting

#### Emotional Core for WordRun

**Primary Emotion**: Accomplishment (word-chain completion makes you feel smart and capable)

**Supporting Emotions**:
1. **Curiosity** - Story reveals between levels create narrative pull
2. **Calm Confidence** - Meditative typing rhythm, not frantic or anxiety-inducing
3. **Social Pride** - Streak maintenance becomes identity, shareable achievements
4. **Delight** - Satisfying microinteractions, celebratory moments, Ruut reactions

### 3. Specific Implementation Patterns Documented

#### Typing Microinteraction Design (Action 1 - CRITICAL)

**Every Letter Typed:**
- Subtle scale animation (1.0 → 1.1 → 1.0) over 100ms
- Gentle haptic tick on keystroke (if enabled)
- Letters appear with 50ms fade-in
- Clean typography (16-18pt minimum mobile)

**Word Submission - CORRECT:**
```
1. Submit word (auto-detect or space)
2. 100ms anticipation pause
3. Word glows green with pulse
4. Ruut jumps to next rung (300ms smooth animation)
5. Particle burst from landing point
6. Satisfying "chime" sound (rising pitch, major key)
7. Word slides into ladder position
8. Combo meter increases with bounce
Total: 500-600ms celebration (worth every millisecond)
```

**Word Submission - INCORRECT:**
```
1. Submit word
2. Quick shake animation (3 shakes, 200ms total)
3. Brief red flash, fade back to white
4. Gentle "womp" sound (NOT harsh buzzer)
5. Helpful hint: "Not quite—think [category]"
6. Ruut shows concerned but encouraging expression
7. Input clears automatically
Total: 400ms (faster than success—don't dwell on failure)
```

#### Chain Completion Celebration (Action 2 - CRITICAL)

**2-3 Second Epic Sequence:**
```
1. Final word locks in
2. Brief pause (200ms) - anticipation
3. All 11 words light up sequentially (bottom to top, 100ms each)
4. Ruut celebration animation (3-4 variations to prevent repetition):
   - Option A: Victory jump with fist pump
   - Option B: Happy dance
   - Option C: Triumphant pose
5. Confetti explosion or particle burst (700ms)
6. Screen flash or subtle shake
7. Triumphant musical flourish (3-4 note melody)
8. Stats reveal with smooth animations (time, perfect words, max combo)
9. Star rating appears (1-3 stars based on performance)
10. XP bar fills with satisfying sound
11. Transition to next level or results
```

#### Ruut Character Personality (Action 3 - HIGH)

**Core Personality Traits:**
- Determined but not aggressive
- Expressive and relatable
- Encouraging partner (celebrates WITH you)
- Shows effort and struggle (makes victories sweeter)

**Required Animation States:**
1. **Idle**: Gentle breathing, occasional look around, subtle bounce every 3-5 seconds
2. **Climbing**: Visible effort pulling up, different climb animations for variety
3. **Success**: Quick fist pump, happy hop, confident stance
4. **Failure**: Brief slump, quick recovery (resilient), encouraging look to player
5. **Celebration**: Big jump, victory dance, triumphant pose (3-4 variations minimum)
6. **Struggle**: Wipes brow, determined expression, shows challenge without defeat

**Sound Design:**
- No voice/words (international appeal)
- Expressive sound effects: "Hmm," "Yay!" "Oof!"
- Endearing, not annoying
- Can be muted without losing experience

#### Story Integration Pattern (Action 4 - HIGH)

**Between Levels (Light Touch):**
```
Timing: 3-5 seconds if player skips, 10-15 seconds if engaged

1. Chain completion finishes
2. 1-2 second transition
3. NPC slides in from side
4. Speech bubble: 1-2 sentences
5. Player choice:
   - Tap anywhere to continue (skip)
   - Tap speech bubble to expand for more lore
6. NPC slides out
7. Next level begins immediately
```

**Land Transitions (Rich Touch):**
```
Timing: 30-60 seconds, fully skippable

1. Final level (25th) completes
2. Zoom out to show completed land on map
3. Animated path extends to next land
4. Brief cutscene (3-5 illustrated panels OR 15-30 second animation)
5. Story beat: Why we're going to the next land
6. New land visual reveal with name
7. First level begins
8. "Skip" button always visible
9. Cutscene replayable in gallery/codex
```

**Key Principles:**
- ✅ Always skippable (respect player time)
- ✅ Replayable (for curious players)
- ✅ Brief by default (don't assume everyone wants lore)
- ✅ Optional depth (reward curiosity)
- ❌ Never gate gameplay behind story
- ❌ Never repeat same dialogue

#### Streak System Design (Action 5 - HIGH)

**Streak Display:**
- Location: Prominent on home screen
- Visual: Flame icon + number of days
- Celebration points: 7, 30, 100, 365 days
- Unique badges/titles at milestones
- Cosmetic rewards for achievements
- Social sharing capability

**Streak Protection (Duolingo's Killer Feature):**
- **Streak Freeze**: Earn 1 free freeze per week of active play
- Purchase additional freezes (IAP or watch ad)
- Max 2 freezes banked
- Auto-uses if you miss a day (with notification)

**Notifications (Use Carefully):**
- Morning nudge (9 AM local): "Start your day with WordRun!"
- Evening reminder (8 PM local): "Your 47-day streak is waiting!"
- Critical (11 PM local): "Don't lose your 47-day streak! 1 hour left!"
- Never spam: Max 2 notifications per day
- Easy to disable in settings

**Emotional Framing:**
- Don't shame ("You failed!")
- Do encourage ("Your journey continues!")
- Celebrate milestones meaningfully
- Show streak on shareable results

### 4. Retention & Monetization Alignment

#### Daily/Weekly Engagement Loops (Action 10 - HIGH)

**Daily Loop (5-15 minutes):**
1. **Daily Challenge**: One unique word chain per day, shareable results (Wordle-style grid), bonus rewards
2. **Daily Login Reward**: Calendar showing 7 days, escalating value (day 7 is premium), one-tap claim
3. **Streak Check-In**: Prominently displayed, milestone celebrations, streak freeze safety net

**Weekly Loop (30-60 minutes total):**
1. **Weekly Challenges**: Complete 10 chains, achieve 50 perfect words, complete 1 land
2. **Friend Leaderboards**: Weekly reset (Monday 00:00), compete for top spot, rewards for top 3
3. **Story Arc Payoff**: Each land takes ~1 week, story revelation at completion, cliffhanger for next

**Long-Term Loop (Months):**
1. **Meta-Progression**: Player level (XP across all play), profile customization unlocks, titles/badges
2. **Story Completion**: 120 lands = months of content, overarching mystery, character development
3. **Mastery Systems**: WPM improvement tracking, perfect chain count, rare achievements

#### Ethical Monetization Design (Action 9 - CRITICAL)

**Core Principle**: Never gate story content or core progression behind paychecks. Monetize convenience and self-expression, not narrative.

**Revenue Streams (Ethical):**

1. **Rewarded Video Ads** (Always optional)
   - Fair value: 30-second ad = 3 hint tokens or 1 life
   - Placement: After losing, when out of hints, optional boost
   - Framing: "Watch ad to continue" (not "Pay or suffer")

2. **Consumable IAP**
   - Hint tokens: $0.99 for 5, $1.99 for 15, $4.99 for 50
   - Power-up packs, life refills, streak freezes
   - Framing: "Convenience, not necessity"

3. **Cosmetic IAP**
   - Ruut skins/outfits ($0.99-$2.99)
   - UI themes ($1.99)
   - Particle effects, sound packs
   - Framing: "Express yourself, support WordRun"
   - Never affects gameplay

4. **Premium Pass ($4.99/month subscription)**
   - Ad-free experience
   - 2× hint token generation
   - Exclusive cosmetics (not power)
   - Early access to new lands (1 week)
   - Bonus story content (side stories, not main plot)
   - Framing: "VIP experience"
   - Free players can complete 100%

5. **One-Time Premium ($9.99)**
   - Remove all ads forever
   - Unlock all current cosmetics
   - Permanent convenience boost
   - Framing: "Own WordRun outright"
   - Best value proposition

**What NOT to Monetize (Red Lines):**
- ❌ Main story content
- ❌ Level access
- ❌ Core mechanics
- ❌ Required progression
- ❌ Competitive advantages (no pay-to-win)

**Emotional Framing Examples:**

**BAD**: "You're out of lives! Pay $2.99 or wait 4 hours!"
**GOOD**: "Take a break! Lives refill in 30 minutes. Or watch an ad to continue now."

**BAD**: "Unlock the ending for $9.99!"
**GOOD**: "Thanks for playing! Unlock bonus side stories and cosmetics for $4.99."

- Director's goal: Story infused directly into gameplay, not an add-on
- Session output: Story integration pattern (3-5 second NPC dialogues, 30-60 second cutscenes, always skippable/replayable)
- Alignment: Story enhances without interrupting; players who engage get depth, players who skip aren't punished

**2. Quality Over Speed (Design Right, Then Build):**
- Director's goal: Take time to design excellence before implementation
- Session output: 58,000-word research report + prioritized Top 10 actions + implementation roadmap
- Alignment: Comprehensive emotional design foundation informs every future decision; no guesswork

**3. Design Excellence Pillar:**
- Director's goal: UI/UX overhaul based on market insights and story integration
- Session output: Norman's three levels framework, typing microinteraction specs, Ruut personality design
- Alignment: Emotional design principles translate directly to visual/interaction specifications

**4. Market Research Informed:**
- Director's goal: Evidence-based decisions from competitive landscape analysis
- Session output: Real-world examples (Candy Crush, Duolingo, Wordle, Wordscapes) showing proven patterns
- Alignment: Each design pattern backed by successful game precedent

**5. Four Pillars Integration:**
- Director's goal: Market Research + Story/Lore + Monetization + Design Excellence working together
- Session output: Emotional design bridges all pillars (story = reflective design, monetization = ethical framing, design = visceral/behavioral)
- Alignment: Emotional design is the connective tissue between strategic pillars

**6. Player-First Philosophy:**
- Director's goal: Create experiences players love and recommend
- Session output: Ethical monetization, generous typo forgiveness, always-skippable story, loss aversion psychology
- Alignment: Every design decision respects player time, agency, and emotional well-being

### Conflicts or Tensions to Resolve in Future Sessions

**1. Animation Production Workload:**
- **Observation**: Ruut requires 3-4 varied celebration animations + idle/climbing/success/failure states
- **Challenge**: Animation production is time/resource intensive
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Start with 1 celebration animation, iterate to 3-4 based on player feedback
  - Prioritize idle/climbing/success states first (most frequent)
  - Consider procedural animation techniques or hired animator
- **Next Steps**: Budget animation production timeline in story/lore development phase

**2. Performance vs Visual Fidelity:**
- **Observation**: 60fps non-negotiable, but heavy animations (confetti, particles) can drop frames
- **Challenge**: Balance visual "juice" with performance targets
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Object pooling for particles (reuse, don't recreate)
  - Level-of-detail system (reduce particles on lower-end devices)
  - Profile early and often on mid-range devices (iPhone 11, Galaxy A52)
- **Next Steps**: Establish performance budgeting in Production phase (Phase 4)

**3. Story Depth vs Gameplay Flow:**
- **Observation**: Director wants story-first integration; players want uninterrupted puzzle flow
- **Challenge**: Finding the right balance between narrative depth and gameplay accessibility
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Use research-backed pattern: 3-5 seconds default, always skippable, optional depth
  - A/B test story density during soft launch (light vs medium narrative)
  - Track story engagement metrics (>70% watch cutscenes = good signal)
- **Next Steps**: Define story density tiers in Story/Lore framework (next session)

**4. Monetization Perception:**
- **Observation**: Ethical monetization requires careful framing to avoid feeling exploitative
- **Challenge**: Penalty box + lives system can feel like "pay-to-progress" if poorly communicated
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Frame penalty box as "take a break" (health benefit) not punishment
  - Always offer ad option alongside IAP (player choice)
  - Test messaging during soft launch; adjust based on sentiment
- **Next Steps**: Write monetization copy in player-friendly language; user-test before launch

**5. Typing UX on Mobile (Critical Challenge):**
- **Observation**: Mobile keyboards are inconsistent across iOS/Android, autocorrect interferes with puzzle
- **Challenge**: Ensuring typing feels good on real devices (not just browser prototypes)
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Use Playwright for initial research (Action 7 in Top 10)
  - Test on real devices early (iOS Safari, Chrome Android)
  - Consider custom input method if native keyboard too problematic
  - Generous typo forgiveness helps mitigate keyboard issues
- **Next Steps**: Typing UX research sprint using Playwright; validate on devices in Production phase

**6. Streak System Pressure:**
- **Observation**: Streaks drive retention (proven) but can create unhealthy obligation
- **Challenge**: Balance engagement with player well-being
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Offer streak freeze mechanic (Duolingo model)
  - Cap notifications at 2 per day, easy to disable
  - Weekly streaks as alternative (less daily pressure)
  - Communicate: "We respect your time"
- **Next Steps**: Define streak notification copy; make opt-out prominent

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities (Next Session)

**Priority 1: Story & Lore Integration (Pillar 2 - CRITICAL PATH)**

Now that emotional design framework is established, story development can be informed by reflective design principles (identity, storytelling, memory creation).

1. **Character Development (Informed by Emotional Design):**
   - Ruut's personality traits align with emotional core (determined, expressive, encouraging)
   - Character arc structure: milestones every 25 levels (land transitions)
   - Supporting NPCs designed for reflective engagement (diverse personalities, relatable struggles)
   - Character visual identity: 2.5D style, animation states documented (idle, climbing, success, failure, celebration × 3-4)

2. **World-Building Framework (Visceral Design):**
   - 120 lands themed around emotional palettes (early = warm/welcoming, mid = saturated/exciting, late = sophisticated)
   - 12 seasonal land groups (10 lands each) for thematic coherence
   - Overarching narrative arc: beginning (discovery) → middle (challenge) → end (triumph)
   - Land-specific lore ties to word associations (puzzle mechanics as storytelling vehicle)

3. **Narrative Delivery Methods (Behavioral Design):**
   - NPC speech cards: 3-5 seconds default, tap to expand for optional depth
   - In-game dialogue: Contextual NPC pop-ins during gameplay (non-intrusive)
   - Animated cutscenes: 30-60 second land transitions (fully skippable, replayable in gallery)
   - Story density tiers: Light (early game) → Medium (mid-game) → Rich (late game)

**Priority 2: Design System Development (Pillar 4 - 50% Complete)**

Emotional design framework now enables visual design decisions with clear rationale.

1. **Competitive Visual Benchmarking (Using Playwright MCP):**
   - Capture screenshots from Candy Crush (celebration sequences), Wordscapes (calm aesthetics), Words With Friends (social UI)
   - Analyze color palettes, typography choices, button styles, animation patterns
   - Document design patterns: level progression UI, lives display, power-up inventory, leaderboards
   - Create inspiration board with emotional design annotations (visceral/behavioral/reflective analysis)

2. **Typing UX Research (Critical Challenge):**
   - Use Playwright to prototype typing interactions in browser
   - Test typo forgiveness visualization (how to show Levenshtein distance correction)
   - Design input field states (default, focus, typing, correct, incorrect, typo-forgiven)
   - Prototype mobile keyboard behaviors (autocorrect interference, input lag mitigation)

3. **Component Library (Phaser Implementation):**
   - Button component: Scale animation (0.95x on press), haptic feedback, sound effect, 4 states
   - Card component: NPC speech cards with slide-in animation, tap-to-expand interaction
   - Progress bars: Smooth fill animations with sound, bounce on completion, XP/combo bars
   - Modal dialogs: Stagger fade-in for child elements, gentle background overlay, clear close affordance

**Priority 3: Monetization Design Finalization (Pillar 3 - 75% Complete)**

Ethical monetization framework established; now design specific IAP catalog and ad placements.

1. **IAP Catalog Design (Informed by Ethical Framework):**
   - **Starter Packs**: $0.99 (5 hints + 1 life), $1.99 (15 hints + 3 lives), $4.99 (50 hints + 10 lives + cosmetic)
   - **Cosmetic Items**: Ruut skins ($0.99-$2.99), UI themes ($1.99), particle effects ($0.99), sound packs ($1.99)
   - **Battle Pass**: $4.99/month (ad-free, 2× hint generation, exclusive cosmetics, early access to lands)
   - **Premium Unlock**: $9.99 one-time (remove ads forever, unlock all current cosmetics, permanent convenience)
   - **Emotional Framing**: Each IAP has player-friendly description ("Skip the wait," "Express yourself," "Support WordRun")

2. **Ad Placement Strategy:**
   - **Rewarded Video**: After losing a life (offer before penalty box), when out of hints (offer 3 hints for ad), optional boost (double combo for next chain)
   - **Interstitial**: After every 5 levels completed (frequency adjustable based on retention impact)
   - **Banner Ads**: Never use (too intrusive for puzzle games)
   - **Player Control**: Always optional, clearly presented, "No thanks" button prominent

3. **Live-Ops Calendar (4-Week Cycles):**
   - **Week 1**: New seasonal land group released (10 lands, thematic event)
   - **Week 2**: Daily challenge bonus rewards (2× XP, exclusive cosmetic unlock)
   - **Week 3**: Weekend tournament (leaderboard competition, top 10% get premium currency)
   - **Week 4**: Community challenge (collective goal, unlock new story content when reached)
   - **Seasonal Events**: 25% revenue spikes proven (Halloween, Christmas, Valentine's, Summer)

### Open Questions for Next Session

1. **Animation Production Budget**: Should Ruut animations be hand-crafted (higher quality, more time) or procedural (faster, more variation)? Or hire animator?

2. **Story Density A/B Test**: Should soft launch test light vs medium narrative density? Or commit to one approach based on director's vision?

3. **Typing UX Approach**: If mobile keyboards prove too problematic, should we build custom input method? Or optimize around native keyboard quirks?

4. **Monetization Priority**: Should IAP catalog be finalized before story/lore (to know what cosmetics to create)? Or story first (to design thematic cosmetics)?

5. **Accessibility Features**: Should accessibility (high contrast, reduced motion, screen reader) be designed now or added in Production phase?

6. **Soft Launch Metrics**: Are success criteria established in research (D1 >40%, D7 >20%, D30 >10%, ARPDAU >$0.10) realistic for typing-based niche?

- Excitement/Anticipation: Variable rewards, limited-time events
- Social Connection: Multiplayer, leaderboards, gifting
- Pride/Status: Rare achievements, visible badges
- Loss Aversion: Streaks at risk, limited resources
- Curiosity: Mystery boxes, story cliffhangers

**Framework 5: Microinteraction Design Recipe**
```
TRIGGER (user action or system event)
  ↓
RULES (what happens when triggered)
  ↓
FEEDBACK (visual, audio, haptic)
  ↓
LOOPS & MODES (variation based on context)
```
Three-Second Rule: Start <100ms, complete 300-500ms, vary each time

### Implementation Roadmap (4 Phases)

**Phase 1: Core Feel (Week 1-2) - CRITICAL**
1. Action 1: Typing microinteraction (every keystroke satisfying)
2. Action 2: Chain completion celebration (2-3 second epic sequence)
3. Action 8: Performance optimization (60fps non-negotiable)

**Phase 2: Emotional Anchor (Week 3-4) - HIGH**
4. Action 3: Ruut personality & animation (3-4 celebration variations)
5. Action 6: Generous typo forgiveness (visual feedback when corrected)
6. Action 7: Juice all interactions (buttons, menus, power-ups, score bars)

**Phase 3: Retention Systems (Week 5-6) - HIGH**
7. Action 5: Streak system (daily streaks, freeze mechanic, milestones)
8. Action 10: Daily/weekly loops (challenges, rewards, leaderboards)
9. Action 9: Ethical monetization design (IAP catalog, ad placement, framing)

**Phase 4: Differentiation (Week 7-8) - HIGH**
10. Action 4: Story integration (NPC dialogues, cutscenes, skippable/replayable)
