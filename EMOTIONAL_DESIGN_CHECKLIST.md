# Emotional Design Checklist: Make People Love Your Work

This checklist helps you create designs that people connect with on an emotional level. It's broken down into three layers of design, based on Don Norman's "Emotional Design" principles: Visceral, Behavioral, and Reflective.

**How to Use This:** Go through each item and see how your design (an app, a website, a poster, etc.) stacks up. Be honest! This is a tool to find opportunities to make your work more engaging and memorable.

## Part 1: Visceral Design (The "Gut" Reaction)

*This is about first impressions. It's the lizard brain stuff—the immediate, instinctual feeling you get from looking at something. It's all about appearance.*

### 1. Color Palette
- [ ] **Does the color scheme create the right mood?**
    - **Why it Matters:** Colors have powerful emotional associations. Blue can be calming, red can be energetic or alarming, and yellow can feel optimistic. The right palette makes a user *feel* the intended emotion before they even know what your project is about.
    - **Action:** Pick 2-3 primary colors that match your goal. Use a color wheel tool (like Adobe Color) to find complementary or analogous colors that work well together.
    - **Example:** A meditation app using soft blues and greens feels calming. A fast-food delivery app using bright reds and yellows feels energetic and urgent.

### 2. Typography & Fonts
- [ ] **Do the fonts feel appropriate for the content?**
    - **Why it Matters:** Fonts have personality. A formal, serif font (like Times New Roman) feels serious and traditional. A rounded, sans-serif font (like Comic Sans, but maybe... better) feels friendly and casual. The right font makes your words *feel* right.
    - **Action:** Choose a font that matches your design's personality. Is it playful? Elegant? Modern? Make sure it's readable!
    - **Example:** A lawyer's website using a script font like "Lobster" would feel unprofessional. A child's birthday invitation using a stark, minimalist font would feel cold.

### 3. Shapes & Imagery
- [ ] **Are the shapes and images visually pleasing and on-brand?**
    - **Why it Matters:** Our brains are wired to react to shapes. Soft, rounded corners feel safe and friendly. Sharp, angular lines feel efficient and modern, but can also feel harsh. High-quality images create a feeling of quality and trustworthiness.
    - **Action:** Use rounded buttons and containers for a friendly vibe. Use sharp, clean lines for a more corporate or futuristic look. Ensure all images are high-resolution and fit the theme.
    - **Example:** A bank's app using sharp corners and a grid layout feels secure and organized. A social app for pet owners using circles and organic shapes feels warm and community-oriented.

### 4. Animation & Motion (The "Juice")
- [ ] **Do animations feel smooth, responsive, and delightful?**
    - **Why it Matters:** Good animation makes an interface feel alive and responsive. A button that subtly scales up when you tap it feels more satisfying than one that just disappears. It provides feedback and adds a touch of magic.
    - **Action:** Add small, quick animations to buttons, menus, and page transitions. The goal is to make things feel natural, not distracting.
    - **Example:** The "like" button on Twitter/X that bursts into confetti. The way app icons on iOS jiggle when you're about to delete them.

## Part 2: Behavioral Design (The "Doing" Experience)

*This is about the experience of actually using the product. It's about feeling capable, smart, and in control. Usability is the key.*

### 1. Ease of Use
- [ ] **Can someone use this for the first time without instructions?**
    - **Why it Matters:** If people can't figure out how to use your design, they'll feel frustrated or stupid—and they'll blame your design, not themselves. An easy-to-use product makes the user feel competent and respected.
    - **Action:** Keep it simple. Don't hide important buttons. Use common icons that people already understand (e.g., a trash can for delete). Ask a friend to try it without any help.
    - **Example:** The Google search page is just a bar. You know exactly what to do. A well-designed checkout process on a shopping site guides you step-by-step.

### 2. Feedback & Response
- [ ] **Does the design clearly communicate what's happening?**
    - **Why it Matters:** Good feedback tells the user their action was successful (or not). It reduces uncertainty and builds trust. Without feedback, users feel anxious and confused. "Did my click work? Is it loading?"
    - **Action:** Show a loading spinner after a button is pressed. Display a clear success message ("Your message has been sent!"). If there's an error, explain it simply.
    - **Example:** When you send an email, a little "Sent" notification pops up. When you get a password wrong, the input field shakes or turns red.

### 3. Performance & Speed
- [ ] **Is it fast? Does it keep the user waiting?**
    - **Why it Matters:** Slowness is one of the most frustrating experiences. A fast, snappy interface makes the user feel powerful and efficient. A slow one makes them feel like they're wasting their life.
    - **Action:** Optimize image sizes. Make sure your website or app loads in under 2-3 seconds. If something *must* take time, use a progress bar to manage expectations.
    - **Example:** Instagram pre-loads images as you scroll, so they appear instantly. This feels seamless and magical. A website that takes 10 seconds to load a single page feels broken.

### 4. Sense of Control
- [ ] **Does the user feel like they are in charge?**
    - **Why it Matters:** People need to feel they have control over their technology. Annoying pop-ups, auto-playing videos, or things that are hard to "undo" make people feel helpless and disrespected.
    - **Action:** Make it easy to go back or cancel an action. Provide settings so users can customize their experience. Never hijack the screen with unexpected content.
    - **Example:** A good "undo" button is the ultimate safety net. A video game that lets you adjust the difficulty and controls makes you feel in command of your experience.

## Part 3: Reflective Design (The "Meaningful" Connection)

*This is the highest level of emotional design. It's about how the product relates to your user's identity, tells a story, and creates long-term meaning.*

### 1. Identity & Self-Expression
- [ ] **Does this product let me express who I am (or who I want to be)?**
    - **Why it Matters:** We love products that reflect our identity. Owning a beautifully designed product, or using an app that aligns with our values, makes us feel good about ourselves. It becomes part of our story.
    - **Action:** Allow for personalization (like custom themes, profiles, or avatars). Build a brand that stands for something your target users care about (e.g., sustainability, creativity, efficiency).
    - **Example:** Customizing your Spotify profile with your favorite artists. Choosing a unique phone case. Driving a certain brand of car because of what it says about you.

### 2. Storytelling & Narrative
- [ ] **Does using this product tell a story or create a memory?**
    - **Why it Matters:** Stories are how we make sense of the world. A design that takes us on a journey, or helps us create our own, is far more memorable and emotionally resonant.
    - **Action:** Think about the "journey" a user takes. Onboarding can be a "welcome" story. Completing a task can be a "victory." Use mascots or characters to guide users.
    - **Example:** Duolingo turns language learning into a game with levels, streaks, and a cute owl mascot, creating a story of personal progress. Headspace uses charming animations to tell stories that simplify complex meditation concepts.

### 3. Connection & Community
- [ ] **Does this product help me connect with other people?**
    - **Why it Matters:** As humans, we are driven by a need to connect. Products that facilitate meaningful social connections create powerful emotional bonds and lasting loyalty.
    - **Action:** Integrate features for sharing, commenting, or collaborating. Create a sense of a shared community space.
    - **Example:** Strava isn't just a run tracker; it's a community where friends give each other "kudos" for their workouts. TikTok's duets and stitches allow users to create content *together*.

### 4. Lasting Memories & Value
- [ ] **Will the user remember this experience fondly?**
    - **Why it Matters:** This is the ultimate goal. A positive memory is what brings people back and makes them recommend your product to others. It's the sum of all the visceral, behavioral, and reflective parts working together.
    - **Action:** Look for a "peak" moment in your experience (the most enjoyable part) and a positive "end" (the feeling of accomplishment). Make those moments shine.
    - **Example:** The feeling of finally beating a hard level in a game. The "Year in Review" from Spotify that summarizes your musical journey. The satisfaction of looking at a well-organized to-do list you just completed.

## The Five-Minute Emotional Design Test

Can't do the full checklist? Try this quick test:

1. **Show it to someone new** (friend, family member). What's their first reaction? (Visceral)

2. **Ask them to complete one task** without your help. Do they succeed? Do they feel smart? (Behavioral)

3. **Ask: "What does this say about the person who uses it?"** If they can articulate an identity or lifestyle, you've achieved reflective design.

4. **Ask: "Would you use this daily?"** If yes, you've created emotional engagement.

5. **Ask: "Would you tell a friend about this?"** If yes, you've created an experience worth sharing.

If you can answer "yes" to questions 2, 4, and 5, you're on the right track.

## Remember:

- **Visceral** = First impression (Does it look/feel good?)
- **Behavioral** = Using it (Does it work well and make me feel capable?)
- **Reflective** = Long-term (Does it mean something to me?)

All three levels must work together to create a truly emotionally engaging experience.

**Pro Tip**: Start with behavioral design (make it work well), then add visceral appeal (make it look good), and finally layer in reflective design (make it meaningful). You can't build a meaningful experience on top of a broken one.

Good luck, and remember: **People won't remember every feature, but they'll always remember how you made them feel.**
