# World State & Protagonist Travel Routes

This document outlines the political and relational states of the nine nations, both before and after the antagonist's influence accelerates. It also maps out the protagonist's journey through this evolving world.

## Part 1: Reworked "Normal" State (Balanced)

This is the state of the world at the beginning of the game. Relations are a mix of established alliances, known enmities, and a majority of cautious neutrality.

*   **Total Unique Relationships:** 36
*   **Distribution:**
    *   **Enemy:** 8 pairs
    *   **Ally:** 5 pairs
    *   **Neutral:** 23 pairs

#### **Relations Matrix (Normal State)**

| Nation | Aethelgard (Love/Hatred) | Carnea (Joy/Drunkenness) | Salomia (Peace/Strife) | Gilead (Longsuffering/Wrath) | Niridia (Gentleness/Murders) | Tobin (Goodness/Envyings) | Kanaan (Faith/Idolatry) | Patmos (Meekness/Witchcraft) | Corinthia (Temperance/Adultery) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Aethelgard (Love/Hatred)** | - | Neutral | **Enemy** | **Enemy** | **Enemy** | **Enemy** | Neutral | Neutral | Neutral |
| **Carnea (Joy/Drunkenness)**| Neutral | - | Neutral | Neutral | Neutral | Neutral | **Enemy** | Neutral | **Ally** |
| **Kanaan (Faith/Idolatry)**| Neutral | **Enemy**| Neutral | **Ally**| Neutral | Neutral | - | **Enemy**| Neutral |
| **Corinthia (Temperance/Adultery)**| Neutral| **Ally**| Neutral | Neutral | Neutral | Neutral | Neutral | Neutral | - |
| **Gilead (Longsuffering/Wrath)**| **Enemy**| Neutral | **Enemy** | - | **Enemy** | Neutral | **Ally** | Neutral | Neutral |
| **Niridia (Gentleness/Murders)**| **Enemy**| Neutral | Neutral | **Enemy** | - | **Ally** | Neutral | Neutral | Neutral |
| **Patmos (Meekness/Witchcraft)**| Neutral| Neutral | Neutral | Neutral | Neutral | Neutral | **Enemy** | - | Neutral |
| **Salomia (Peace/Strife)**| **Enemy** | Neutral | - | **Enemy** | Neutral | **Ally** | Neutral | Neutral | Neutral |
| **Tobin (Goodness/Envyings)**| **Enemy**| Neutral | **Ally** | Neutral | **Ally** | - | Neutral | Neutral | Neutral |

#### **Justification for Key Relations:**

*   **Enemies:** Relations are primarily driven by ideological opposition (e.g., Kanaan's `Idolatry` vs. Carnea's hedonism) or direct provocations between flaws (e.g., Aethelgard's `Hatred` vs. Gilead's `Wrath`).
*   **Allies:** Alliances form from mutual benefit (e.g., Carnea and Corinthia's dysfunctional bond over indulgence) or shared virtues (e.g., Salomia and Tobin's desire for stability; Gilead and Kanaan's "holy warrior" pact).
*   **Neutrals:** The default state. Most nations are too consumed with their internal struggles or specific rivalries to engage with everyone.

## Part 2: Aggressive "Second Half" State

After the midpoint, the antagonist actively exploits each nation's flaws, turning the world into a powder keg.

*   **New Relationship Type: Tense** - Nations are on the brink of war, with heavy border fortifications and deep political suspicion. Travel is highly restricted and dangerous.
*   **Distribution (36 total pairs):**
    *   **Enemies:** 17 pairs
    *   **Tense:** 11 pairs
    *   **Neutral:** 8 pairs

#### **Relations Matrix (Aggressive State)**

| Nation | Aethelgard (Love/Hatred) | Carnea (Joy/Drunkenness) | Salomia (Peace/Strife) | Gilead (Longsuffering/Wrath) | Niridia (Gentleness/Murders) | Tobin (Goodness/Envyings) | Kanaan (Faith/Idolatry) | Patmos (Meekness/Witchcraft) | Corinthia (Temperance/Adultery) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Aethelgard (Love/Hatred)** | - | **Enemy** | **Enemy** | **Enemy** | **Enemy** | **Enemy** | **Tense** | **Tense** | **Enemy** |
| **Carnea (Joy/Drunkenness)**| **Enemy** | - | **Tense** | **Enemy** | Neutral | **Tense** | **Enemy**| Neutral | **Tense** |
| **Corinthia (Temperance/Adultery)**| **Enemy**| **Tense**| **Enemy** | **Tense**| Neutral | **Tense** | **Enemy**| **Tense** | - |
| **Gilead (Longsuffering/Wrath)**| **Enemy**| **Enemy**| **Enemy**| - | **Enemy** | **Enemy**| **Enemy**| **Tense** | **Tense** |
| **Kanaan (Faith/Idolatry)**| **Tense** | **Enemy**| Neutral | **Enemy**| **Tense** | **Tense** | - | **Enemy** | **Enemy** |
| **Niridia (Gentleness/Murders)**| **Enemy**| Neutral | **Tense** | **Enemy**| - | **Tense** | **Tense** | **Enemy** | Neutral |
| **Patmos (Meekness/Witchcraft)**| **Tense**| Neutral | Neutral | **Tense**| **Enemy**| Neutral | **Enemy** | - | **Tense** |
| **Salomia (Peace/Strife)**| **Enemy** | **Tense**| - | **Enemy** | **Tense** | **Tense** | Neutral | Neutral | **Enemy** |
| **Tobin (Goodness/Envyings)**| **Enemy**| **Tense**| **Tense**| **Enemy** | **Tense** | - | **Tense** | Neutral | **Tense** |

#### **Justification for Escalation:**

The antagonist's propaganda and political machinations cause alliances to shatter and neutral nations to become paranoid and hostile. The world becomes a web of interconnected conflicts.

## Part 3: Protagonist's Travel Routes

The routes are determined by the political realities of each half of the game. Travel is assumed to be possible between **Ally** and **Neutral** nations, and highly dangerous but possible through **Tense** nations. **Enemy** borders are closed entirely.

*   **Protagonist's Home Nation:** Corinthia (Temperance/Adultery)
*   **Package's Destination Nation:** Tobin (Goodness/Envyings)

### First Half Route: "The Delivery"

The protagonist must find a path from Corinthia to Tobin. He must leverage the alliances and neutral relationships of the "Normal State."

**Path: Corinthia → Carnea → Salomia → Tobin**

1.  **Corinthia to Carnea (Ally):** The journey begins by crossing into Corinthia's only allied nation. This first step is relatively easy, introducing the protagonist to the concept of international travel and cultural differences in a low-stakes environment.
2.  **Carnea to Salomia (Neutral):** From the celebratory lands of Carnea, the protagonist travels to the politically tense Salomia. As a neutral party from a neutral nation, he can navigate their internal `Strife` without being seen as a threat, learning about how a nation's flaws affect its people.
3.  **Salomia to Tobin (Ally):** The final leg of the delivery. He travels from Salomia to its ally, Tobin. Arriving here signifies the completion of his initial quest and leads directly into the game's midpoint reversal.

### Second Half Route: "The Escape and Restoration"

After the midpoint in Tobin, the protagonist must return home to Corinthia. The world has shifted to the "Aggressive State," and his original path is no longer safe. His new mission is to spread the truth, forcing him to confront the new hostility head-on.

**Path: Tobin → Salomia → Carnea → Corinthia**

1.  **Tobin to Salomia (Tense):** His first step is the most dangerous. The once-allied nations are now suspicious of each other. The protagonist must navigate a hostile border and a land where Tobin's `Envyings` and Salomia's `Strife` are being actively weaponized against each other. His goal is to use the language to remind them of their shared values.
2.  **Salomia to Carnea (Tense):** He continues into another newly hostile territory. The peace-seeking Salomia now views Carnea's excesses as a corrupting influence, while Carnea sees Salomia's internal strife as a threat. The journey is fraught with mistrust.
3.  **Carnea to Corinthia (Tense):** The final leg home is a journey between fractured allies. Corinthia's paranoia has curdled its relationship with Carnea. The protagonist must cross a border defined by suspicion and hypocrisy to reach his hometown, which is now the epicenter of the antagonist's plot. This path forces him to confront the decay of the world firsthand, making his mission to restore truth all the more urgent.
