# WordRun v0.0.02 - Session Summary (2026-01-07)

## Session Type: Project Reboot - Strategic Pivot to Design & Market-Driven Development

This session marked a critical strategic reboot for the WordRun project. After completing initial component extraction work (v0.0.01), the development direction shifted from technical-first refactoring to a strategic, research-informed approach. This pivot represents a fundamental change in philosophy: from "making it work" to "making it great."

---

## From Dev Director's Notes

### Core Vision & Intent

The dev director's vision for WordRun remains anchored in creating a **mobile word-association puzzle game** that combines:
- **Word-chain mechanics** (11 associated words per chain)
- **Candy Crush-style progression** (3,000 levels across 120 themed lands)
- **Competitive gameplay** with leaderboards and typing-based input
- **Lives system** with penalty box mechanics (15-960 min wait times)
- **Story-first integration** (newly emphasized): Narrative infused directly into gameplay, not as an add-on

### Updated Must-Include Features

**Core Mechanics (Stable)**:
- Typing-based gameplay with typo forgiveness (Levenshtein distance)
- Power-up system (hints, skips, surge, freeze)
- Trap system with locked rungs
- Combo system with drainage tiers
- Scoring mechanics (base 100 pts/word + multipliers)

**New Strategic Priorities**:
1. **Market-informed positioning**: Target "competitive word-chain puzzle" niche (blue ocean opportunity)
2. **Hybrid monetization**: IAP + rewarded video ads (37% revenue advantage over single-model)
3. **Live-ops infrastructure**: Seasonal events (25% revenue spikes), weekly leaderboard resets
4. **Story/lore integration**: 120 lands enable deep narrative theming across progression
5. **Social competition**: Leaderboards drive 26% retention lift (research-validated)

### Visual Appeal & User Experience Goals

**Elevated from "functional" to "exceptional"**:
- Professional mobile game aesthetics (benchmark: Candy Crush, Wordscapes quality)
- Story-integrated visuals: Each land's theme reflects narrative progression
- Typing UX optimization: Critical success factor for mobile word-chain gameplay
- Performance: 60 FPS, <2MB bundle, <150MB RAM on mid-range devices
- Accessibility: Typo forgiveness is non-negotiable for retention

---

## From This Session

### 1. Strategic Reboot Decision & Rationale

**The Pivot**: Shifted from technical refactoring (component extraction) to strategic design phase.

**Why This Matters**:
- The functional prototype proved core mechanics work, but market fit remains unvalidated
- Technical optimization without strategic clarity risks building the wrong thing efficiently
- Mobile game market is winner-takes-most; differentiation requires research-informed design
- 84% of mobile IAP comes from live-ops games; strategy must precede implementation

**Decision Timeline**:
1. Reviewed component extraction progress (4 of 5 components extracted)
2. Recognized need for market validation before continuing technical work
3. Launched comprehensive market research (mobile-game-market-analyst agent)
4. Paused technical work to focus on "Four Pillars of Redevelopment"
5. Updated CLAUDE.md to reflect new strategic priorities

### 2. The Four Pillars of Redevelopment Framework

This session established a new strategic framework organizing all work around four priorities:

#### Pillar 1: Market Research & Positioning (IN PROGRESS)
**Goal**: Understand competitive landscape, target demographics, and unique value proposition

**Work Completed**:
- Launched market research agent analyzing puzzle game market ($12.2bn)
- Completed comprehensive 73,000-word market research brief (Market-Research-Brief-2026.md)
- Identified key insights:
  - Puzzle genre: $10bn+ revenue in 2024, 14.9% of total gaming IAP
  - Word puzzle niche: Fragmented (Wordscapes 22%, Words With Friends 15%)
  - Typing-based word-chain games: Underserved blue ocean opportunity
  - Hybrid monetization (IAP + ads): 37% revenue advantage over single-model
  - Leaderboards: 26% retention lift (definitive evidence)
  - CPI benchmarks: iOS $3-4.50, Android $1.10-2
  - Live-ops essential: 84% of mobile IAP from live-ops games

**Key Positioning Recommendation**:
- **Category**: "Competitive Word-Chain Puzzle" (hybrid positioning)
- **Differentiation**: Typing speed + word association skill + real-time leaderboards
- **Gap Analysis**: No dominant typing-based word-chain game with leaderboards at scale

**Actionable Insights for Design**:
- Typo forgiveness is critical (mobile typing friction reduces engagement 15-20%)
- Leaderboard integration must be core (26% D30 retention lift)
- Hybrid monetization required (IAP + rewarded video)
- Lives system (5 per land, 30 min refill) drives 4.1 sessions/day
- Seasonal events create 25% revenue spikes

#### Pillar 2: Story & Lore Integration (NEXT PRIORITY)
**Goal**: Develop narrative framework that enhances engagement and emotional connection

**Current State**:
- Core creative principle established: "Story-first integration is non-negotiable"
- Narrative delivery methods defined:
  - Between levels: NPC speech cards, animated cutscenes
  - During gameplay: On-screen NPCs with context-sensitive dialogue
- 120 lands provide structure for 12 seasonal "land groups" (10 lands per season)

**Pending Work**:
- Character backstories (Ruut the climbing character)
- World-building (120 lands thematic framework)
- Progression narrative (how story evolves across 3,000 levels)
- Integration points (word choices thematically linked to narrative)

**Why This Matters**:
- Story integration creates close-knit community ("players who get it")
- Differentiation from generic word puzzles (Wordscapes, Word Cookies)
- Long-term engagement driver (players invested in narrative progression)
- 120 lands enable deep, multi-season story arcs

#### Pillar 3: Monetization Strategy (RESEARCH COMPLETE, DESIGN PENDING)
**Goal**: Design sustainable revenue model aligned with market expectations

**Research Insights**:
- **What to sell**: Hint tokens ($0.99), skip tokens ($1.99), lives refills ($0.99), power-up bundles ($2.99), battle pass ($4.99), penalty box bypass ($0.99-$4.99 tiered), cosmetics ($1.99-$3.99)
- **When to sell**:
  - Day 1: No IAP prompts (FTUE best practice)
  - Day 2-3: First IAP window (77% convert within 14 days; puzzle games fastest at 1.6-1.7 days)
  - Day 7-14: Leaderboard push window (Wordscapes +20% ARPDAU during tournaments)
  - Day 30+: Whale cultivation (22% of payers spend $100+ by D90)
- **What NOT to sell**: Auto-solve in ranked modes, extra time in competitive play (41% of whales reduce spending due to P2W frustration)
- **Price architecture**: Impulse tier ($0.99-$1.99), value tier ($2.99-$4.99), premium tier ($9.99-$19.99)

**Design Decisions Pending**:
- IAP catalog finalization (8 SKUs recommended)
- Battle pass content design (seasonal cosmetics, Ruut skins)
- Penalty box monetization balance (high churn risk if over-monetized)
- Ad placement strategy (rewarded video for hints/lives, post-level completion)

#### Pillar 4: Design Excellence (STRATEGY PENDING)
**Goal**: Elevate UI/UX from functional to exceptional based on market insights and story integration

**Current State**:
- Functional prototype exists with DOM-based UI
- 4 components extracted (ComboBar, RuutCharacter, HintSystem, PowerUpInventory)
- Asset optimization pending (texture atlases, lazy loading)

**Pending Work**:
- Design system overhaul aligned with story/lore
- Visual design benchmarking (Candy Crush, Wordscapes quality bar)
- Animation strategy (GSAP/Anime.js for UI, Phaser particles for effects)
- Typing UX optimization (keyboard interactions, error states, flow)
- Onboarding design (no ads in first 30 min, freebies for tutorial completion)

**Why This Matters**:
- Winner-takes-most market rewards exceptional quality
- Downloads declining (-7% YoY), engagement rising (+8% YoY); quality over quantity
- D1 retention 35-40% target requires polished FTUE
- Typing UX is make-or-break differentiator for word-chain games

- **Subcategory**: "Competitive Word-Chain Puzzle" (blue ocean positioning)
- **Differentiation**: Typing speed + word association skill + real-time leaderboards
- **ASO keywords**: "word chain," "competitive word game," "typing word puzzle," "leaderboard word game"

**D. Monetization Model**:
- **Hybrid required**: IAP + rewarded video ads (37% revenue advantage)
- **IAP catalog**: 8 SKUs ($0.99-$19.99 tiers)
- **Battle pass**: $4.99 seasonal progression (66% of top-20% games use it)
- **Price architecture**: Impulse ($0.99-$1.99), value ($2.99-$4.99), premium ($9.99-$19.99)
- **Competitive balance**: No pay-to-win in ranked modes (41% whale spending reduction risk)

**E. Retention Strategy**:
- **Leaderboards core**: 26% D30 retention lift (definitive evidence)
- **Lives system**: 5 per land, 30 min refill (drives 4.1 sessions/day)
- **Daily quests**: Streak bonuses (95% of live-ops games use them)
- **Seasonal events**: 25% revenue spikes (Block Blast, Wordscapes proven)
- **Typo forgiveness**: Critical for typing UX (estimated 10-15% D1 retention lift)

**F. When to Resume Technical Work**:
Technical development will resume after:
1. Market research complete with actionable insights ✓ (DONE)
2. Story/lore framework established (NEXT)
3. Monetization strategy designed (RESEARCH COMPLETE, DESIGN PENDING)
4. Design system approved (PENDING)

### 8. Problems Identified and Solutions Proposed

**Problem 1: Technical Work Without Strategic Clarity**
- **Issue**: Component extraction (v0.0.01) proceeded without market validation
- **Risk**: Building technically sound features that don't differentiate in market
- **Solution**: Pause technical work; complete Four Pillars before resuming development
- **Status**: Work paused; market research complete; story/lore next priority

**Problem 2: Typing UX Is Make-or-Break Differentiator**
- **Issue**: "Typing on mobile is slow, painful, and error-prone" (UXmatters research)
- **Risk**: 15-20% engagement reduction due to typing friction
- **Solution**: Typo forgiveness (1-char Levenshtein within 2s) is non-negotiable
- **Status**: Feature exists in prototype; needs UX testing and refinement

**Problem 3: Penalty Box Monetization Risk**
- **Issue**: No benchmarks found for "pay to skip wait time" in puzzle games
- **Risk**: High churn if players feel unfairly punished (15-960 min wait tiers)
- **Solution**: Offer rewarded video alternative (watch 3 ads to reduce wait 50%) BEFORE IAP prompt
- **Status**: Monetization design pending; A/B testing required in soft launch

**Problem 4: Word-Chain Market Size Unknown**
- **Issue**: No data on typing-based word-chain game revenue or demand
- **Risk**: Blue ocean may be "no ocean" (low market demand, not just low competition)
- **Solution**: Soft launch in tier-2 markets (Canada, Australia) to validate demand
- **Status**: Soft launch plan defined in research brief; target: D7 >18%, ARPDAU >$0.10

**Problem 5: Component Work Orphaned**
- **Issue**: 4 components extracted (v0.0.01) but integration paused
- **Risk**: Code becomes stale; integration effort wasted if design changes significantly
- **Solution**: Archive component work; rebuild informed by design system after Pillar 4
- **Status**: Components archived to `/wordrun-vite/src_archive_2026-01-06/`

**Problem 6: 120 Lands Create Content Burden**
- **Issue**: 120 themed lands (3,000 levels) require massive art/story content
- **Risk**: Production timeline extends 12-18+ months if each land fully custom
- **Solution**: Group lands into 12 seasonal "land groups" (10 lands per season); shared themes
- **Status**: Strategic framework defined; story/lore integration (Pillar 2) will detail execution

### 9. Ideas Explored But Rejected

**Continue Component Extraction Without Research**:
- **Considered**: Finish extracting WordBox component (5th of 5), integrate all components
- **Rejected**: Technical optimization without strategic clarity wastes effort
- **Rationale**:
  - Market research revealed typing UX is critical differentiator
  - Design system overhaul likely after story/lore integration (Pillar 2)
  - Component architecture may change based on Pillar 4 (Design Excellence)
  - Risk: Build technically sound features that don't align with market positioning
- **Compromise**: Archive component work; resume after strategic clarity achieved

**Linear Development Roadmap**:
- **Considered**: Follow DevTec.md 8-week roadmap (Week 1-2 refactoring → Week 3-4 assets)
- **Rejected**: Research-informed design takes precedence over linear execution
- **Rationale**:
  - Mobile game market is winner-takes-most; differentiation requires strategy
  - 84% of IAP from live-ops games; strategy must precede implementation
  - Downloads declining (-7% YoY); market consolidating around quality
  - DevTec.md remains valid for technical work after Pillar 4 complete
- **Compromise**: Use DevTec.md as technical reference; sequence after strategic design

**Pure IAP Monetization** (No Ads):
- **Considered**: Royal Match model (pure IAP, no ads, premium positioning)
- **Rejected**: Hybrid monetization (IAP + ads) shows 37% revenue advantage
- **Rationale**:
  - Royal Match spends 61.5% of revenue on paid UA; unsustainable for indie dev
  - Wordscapes hybrid model (55% ads, 45% IAP) is more accessible
  - Rewarded video ads provide non-payer engagement (78% willing to watch)
  - Puzzle genre standard: 72% of developers use hybrid
- **Compromise**: Offer $9.99 ad-removal IAP for ad-fatigued players

**Aggressive Penalty Box Monetization**:
- **Considered**: Monetize all penalty box wait times (15-960 min) with IAP prompts
- **Rejected**: High churn risk; no benchmarks for this mechanic in puzzle games
- **Rationale**:
  - Players may perceive penalty box as unfair punishment
  - 41% of whales reduce spending due to pay-to-win frustration
  - Candy Crush lives system less punitive (30 min refill vs 960 min max)
  - Risk: Short-term revenue boost, long-term retention damage
- **Compromise**: Offer rewarded video alternative (watch 3 ads to reduce wait 50%) BEFORE IAP prompt; A/B test in soft launch

**Story as Optional Meta-Layer**:
- **Considered**: Light story theming (Candy Crush level) vs deep narrative (Homescapes level)
- **Rejected**: Core creative principle: "Story-first integration is non-negotiable"
- **Rationale**:
  - Director vision: Story infused into gameplay, not add-on
  - Differentiation from generic word puzzles (Wordscapes, Word Cookies)
  - 120 lands provide structure for multi-season story arcs
  - Community-building: Players who "get it" form close-knit audience
- **Commitment**: Pillar 2 (Story & Lore Integration) is next priority after market research

### Conflicts or Tensions to Resolve in Future Sessions

**1. Story Depth vs Development Timeline**:
- **Tension**: Deep story integration (Pillar 2) requires significant content creation (120 lands)
- **Issue**: 120 fully-custom lands = 12-18+ month timeline; risk of scope creep
- **Mitigation**:
  - Group lands into 12 seasonal "land groups" (10 lands per season)
  - Shared themes within land groups reduce unique asset count
  - Prioritize core narrative arc; detailed world-building added post-launch
- **Next Steps**: Story/lore framework (Pillar 2) must define "minimum viable narrative"

**2. Typing UX Validation Gap**:
- **Tension**: Research confirms typing friction is critical barrier, but no UX testing conducted
- **Issue**: WordRun's typo forgiveness may not be sufficient; mobile keyboard interactions untested
- **Mitigation**:
  - Soft launch in tier-2 markets includes mobile device testing (iPhone 11, Galaxy A52)
  - A/B test typo forgiveness settings (1-char vs 2-char Levenshtein; 2s vs 3s window)
  - User testing sessions with target demographic (25-45, casual mobile gamers)
- **Next Steps**: Design Excellence (Pillar 4) must prioritize typing UX research

**3. Penalty Box Monetization Risk**:
- **Tension**: Penalty box (15-960 min wait) is core mechanic, but monetization may drive churn
- **Issue**: No benchmarks for "pay to skip wait time"; high risk of player backlash
- **Mitigation**:
  - Offer rewarded video alternative BEFORE IAP prompt (player choice, not paywalled)
  - A/B test 50% of soft launch users with penalty box, 50% without
  - Track churn rate at 960 min penalty tier (longest wait time)
- **Next Steps**: Monetization Strategy (Pillar 3) must define penalty box pricing and placement

**4. Component Work Integration Delay**:
- **Tension**: 4 components extracted (v0.0.01) but archived pending strategic design
- **Issue**: Technical progress paused; integration effort may be wasted if design changes
- **Mitigation**:
  - Components archived (not deleted); can be restored if architecture remains valid
  - Design system (Pillar 4) will inform component architecture decisions
  - If DOM-based UI remains valid, components can be integrated quickly
- **Next Steps**: Review archived components after Design Excellence (Pillar 4) complete

**5. Build Roadmap Timeline Uncertainty**:
- **Tension**: Strategic design phase duration unknown; production timeline extends
- **Issue**: Four Pillars completion could take weeks to months; opportunity cost vs speed
- **Mitigation**:
  - Set deadline: Complete Pillars 2-4 within 4 weeks (1 week per pillar)
  - Use AI tooling (Claude agents, Playwright MCP) to accelerate design/research
  - Parallel work: Design system mockups while story/lore in progress
- **Next Steps**: Define sprint schedule for Pillars 2-4 (Story → Monetization → Design)

**6. Market Validation Risk**:
- **Tension**: Research identifies blue ocean, but word-chain market size unknown
- **Issue**: Low competition may signal low demand (not just opportunity)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Soft launch validates demand before scaling UA spend
  - Target metrics: D7 >18%, ARPDAU >$0.10 (above benchmarks = market fit)
  - Pivot plan: If soft launch fails, repurpose tech for adjacent word puzzle category
- **Next Steps**: Define soft launch success criteria and pivot thresholds

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities (Next Session)

**Priority 1: Story & Lore Integration Framework (Pillar 2)**
1. **Character development**:
   - Ruut backstory (who is Ruut? why climb the word ladder?)
   - Supporting NPCs (who delivers story between levels? rival climbers?)
   - Character arc progression (how does Ruut evolve across 3,000 levels?)

2. **World-building**:
   - 120 lands thematic framework (12 seasonal land groups, 10 lands per season)
   - Narrative arc structure (beginning/middle/end across 3,000 levels)
   - Integration points (how do word choices reflect narrative themes?)

3. **Delivery methods**:
   - NPC speech card design (between-level narrative)
   - In-game dialogue system (context-sensitive speech bubbles)
   - Animated cutscene plan (frequency, production scope)

4. **Deliverables**:
   - Lore document (world, characters, narrative progression)
   - Story integration plan (how gameplay mechanics tie to narrative)
   - Narrative design spec (writing style, tone, pacing)

**Priority 2: Monetization Strategy Design (Pillar 3)**
1. **IAP catalog finalization**:
   - 8 SKUs pricing and content design
   - Battle pass structure (4-week seasons, cosmetic progression)
   - Penalty box monetization balance (IAP vs rewarded video timing)

2. **Ad placement strategy**:
   - Rewarded video integration (hints, lives, penalty reduction)
   - Interstitial ad placement (post-level, frequency caps)
   - Offerwall evaluation (premium currency exchange)

3. **Live-ops calendar**:
   - Seasonal event design (12 events tied to land groups)
   - Weekly leaderboard structure (global + land-specific)
   - Daily quest system (streak bonuses, coin rewards)

4. **Deliverables**:
   - Monetization design document (IAP catalog, pricing, triggers)
   - Live-ops calendar (first 90 days post-launch)
   - A/B test plan (penalty box, IAP timing, ad frequency)

**Priority 3: Design Excellence Planning (Pillar 4 Prep)**
1. **Competitive visual benchmarking**:
   - Screenshot analysis (Candy Crush, Wordscapes, Royal Match UI/UX)
   - Animation study (leaderboard transitions, power-up effects, level completion)
   - Typing UX research (mobile keyboard best practices)

2. **Design system requirements**:
   - Visual style aligned with story/lore (Pillar 2 output informs this)
   - Component library needs (buttons, modals, leaderboards, NPC dialogue)
   - Animation strategy (GSAP vs Anime.js, Phaser particles)

3. **AI tooling optimization**:
   - Evaluate Playwright MCP for design-to-code workflow
   - Multi-agent coordination (design agents, development agents)

**Priority 4: Soft Launch Preparation**
1. **Success criteria definition**:
   - Retention targets: D1 >35%, D7 >18%, D30 >8%
   - Monetization targets: ARPDAU >$0.10, IAP conversion >3% by D14
   - Technical targets: 60 FPS, <2MB bundle, <150MB RAM

2. **Tier-2 market selection**:
   - Canada, Australia (English-speaking, lower CPI)
   - Validation window: 4-6 weeks
   - Pivot criteria: If D7 <15% or ARPDAU <$0.08, reassess positioning

### Open Questions for Next Session

1. **Story/Lore Scope**: How deep should narrative integration go? (Light theming vs Homescapes-level story)
2. **Penalty Box Retention**: A/B test results required; is mechanic too punitive for casual audience?
3. **Typing UX Validation**: What mobile device testing is needed to validate typo forgiveness adequacy?
4. **120 Lands Production**: How to reduce art/story content burden while maintaining quality?
5. **Component Integration**: When to restore archived components? After Design Excellence (Pillar 4) complete?
6. **DevTec.md Roadmap**: Does 8-week timeline remain valid after strategic design phase? (Likely extends to 12-16 weeks)
