## From Dev Director's Notes

### Core Vision & Intent
The dev director's vision for WordRun continues to emphasize:
- **Story-First Integration**: A non-negotiable principle where narrative is infused directly into gameplay, not treated as an add-on
- **Four Pillars of Redevelopment**: Market Research, Story/Lore, Monetization, and Design Excellence
- **Research-Informed Design**: Strategic shift from "make it work" to "make it great" through data-driven decisions
- **Quality Over Speed**: Taking time to design right, then build once with strategic clarity

### Must-Include Features & Updates (Strategic Phase)
Based on the project reboot (v0.0.02) and market research findings:
- **Leaderboard System**: 26% retention lift proven by research; critical success factor for D30 retention (8-10% target vs 6.6% benchmark)
- **Hybrid Monetization**: IAP + rewarded video ads (37% revenue advantage over single-model games)
- **Live-Ops Infrastructure**: 84% of mobile IAP revenue from live-ops games; seasonal events drive 25% revenue spikes
- **Typing UX Excellence**: Mobile keyboard UX is a critical challenge requiring design research and iteration
- **Social Competition**: Weekly leaderboards, seasonal events, daily quests to drive engagement
- **Story Integration**: NPC speech cards, in-game dialogue, animated cutscenes for narrative delivery

### Visual Appeal & User Experience Goals
- **Design Excellence Pillar**: UI/UX overhaul based on market insights (Candy Crush/Wordscapes quality benchmarks)
- **Design System Required**: Component library, style guide, visual benchmarking against top-performing mobile puzzle games
- **Playwright-Accelerated Workflow**: Use browser automation for rapid prototyping, screenshot analysis, competitive visual benchmarking
- **Accessibility**: Clear typography, haptic feedback, intuitive touch controls on mobile portrait (390x844)

### Conflicts or Tensions to Resolve in Future Sessions

**1. Browser vs Native Mobile Testing:**
- **Observation**: Playwright MCP operates in browser environment
- **Limitation**: Cannot directly test native iOS/Android keyboard behavior
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Use Playwright for initial design research and prototyping
  - Validate typing UX on real devices during Production (Phase 4)
  - Consider Appium or similar for native mobile automation in later phases
- **Next Steps**: Document browser testing limitations; plan native device testing in DevTec.md

**2. Playwright for Competitive Analysis (Ethical Considerations):**
- **Observation**: Playwright can scrape competitor websites for design patterns
- **Consideration**: Respect terms of service, copyright, and fair use
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Use for visual inspiration and pattern analysis (public information)
  - Never copy proprietary assets, code, or content
  - Focus on understanding design principles, not replication
- **Next Steps**: Establish ethical guidelines for competitive research

**3. Design Tool Integration:**
- **Observation**: Playwright operates in browser; Phaser game uses canvas rendering
- **Limitation**: Design prototypes in HTML/CSS must be translated to Phaser
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Use Playwright for UI mockups and visual validation
  - Implement designs in Phaser after validation
  - Consider HTML-based UI (DOM elements) for complex UI components
- **Next Steps**: Decide on canvas vs DOM approach for final UI implementation

**4. Tooling Overhead vs Development Efficiency:**
- **Observation**: Setting up Playwright workflows requires upfront investment
- **Risk**: Over-engineering tooling could delay actual design work
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Start with manual Playwright usage (no automation scripts initially)
  - Build workflows incrementally as value is proven
  - Focus on high-leverage use cases (competitive benchmarking, rapid prototyping)
- **Next Steps**: Prioritize use cases; validate ROI before investing in complex automation

**5. AI Tooling vs Human Creativity:**
- **Observation**: Browser automation accelerates research and iteration
- **Limitation**: Tooling is a means, not a replacement for creative vision
- **Balance Required**:
  - Use Playwright to gather data and validate ideas
  - Reserve creative decisions for human judgment
  - AI tools inform; director's vision guides
- **Philosophy**: Technology accelerates execution; vision drives direction

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities (Next Session)

**Priority 1: Story & Lore Integration (Pillar 2 - CRITICAL PATH)**
1. Character Development:
   - Define Ruut's backstory and character arc across 3,000 levels
   - Create supporting NPC cast with distinct personalities
   - Design character progression system tied to player advancement
   - Establish character visual identity (2.5D art style, expressions, animations)

2. World-Building Framework:
   - Develop thematic framework for 120 lands (12 seasonal groups of 10 lands)
   - Define overarching narrative arc (beginning → middle → end structure)
   - Create land-specific lore that ties to word association puzzles
   - Design meta-narrative connecting lands into cohesive story

3. Narrative Delivery Methods:
   - Design NPC speech card system (between-level story moments)
   - Plan in-game dialogue triggers (contextual NPC pop-ins during gameplay)
   - Outline animated cutscene moments (major story beats at land transitions)
   - Define how story infuses into puzzle mechanics (word choices, difficulty progression)

**Priority 2: Monetization Design (Pillar 3 - 50% Complete, Continue)**
1. IAP Catalog Design:
   - Define starter packs, power-up bundles, cosmetic items
   - Price optimization based on market research ($1.99, $4.99, $9.99 tiers)
   - Battle Pass design (66% of top-20% puzzle games use battle pass)
   - Premium hearts system (bypass penalty box)

2. Ad Placement Strategy:
   - Rewarded video for hint refills (high-value placement)
   - Interstitial ads for level completion (frequency optimization)
   - Ad frequency balance (avoid retention damage)
   - Non-intrusive integration (player control over ad viewing)

3. Live-Ops Calendar:
   - Seasonal event structure (4-week cycles, 25% revenue spikes)
   - Daily quest design (retention driver)
   - Weekly leaderboard cadence (26% retention lift)
   - Content release schedule (new lands, cosmetics, events)

**Priority 3: Design Excellence Preparation (Pillar 4 - Tooling Ready)**
1. Competitive Visual Benchmarking:
   - Use Playwright to capture screenshots from Candy Crush, Wordscapes, Words With Friends
   - Analyze UI patterns: button styles, color schemes, typography, animations
   - Document design patterns: level progression UI, lives display, power-up inventory
   - Create inspiration board with annotated competitor screenshots

2. Typing UX Research:
   - Use Playwright to prototype typing interactions in browser
   - Test mobile keyboard behaviors (autocorrect, suggestions, input lag)
   - Design input field states (default, focus, error, success)
   - Prototype typo forgiveness visualization (Levenshtein distance feedback)

3. Component Library Planning:
   - Identify reusable UI components (buttons, cards, modals, badges)
   - Define component states (default, hover, active, disabled)
   - Plan responsive scaling for 390x844 mobile portrait
   - Prepare for Phaser vs DOM decision (based on performance profiling)

### Open Questions for Next Session

1. **Story Integration Depth**: Should story be light theming (minimal narrative) or deep lore (extensive character development)? Market research suggests deep narrative fosters "close-knit community" (director's vision).

2. **Character Arc Structure**: How should Ruut's character evolve across 3,000 levels? Milestone moments at land transitions (every 25 levels)? Or gradual progression?

3. **World-Building Scale**: Should each of 120 lands have unique lore, or cluster into 12 seasonal groups with shared themes?

4. **Monetization Priority**: Should IAP catalog or ad placement strategy be designed first? Or develop in parallel?

5. **Design System Scope**: Should Design Excellence (Pillar 4) begin in parallel with Story/Lore (Pillar 2), or wait for story completion to inform visual direction?

6. **Playwright Usage Patterns**: Should we create reusable Playwright scripts for common tasks (screenshot capture, visual comparison), or use ad-hoc manual calls?
