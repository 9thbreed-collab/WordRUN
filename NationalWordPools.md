## How to Use This Document

Each nation has word pools organized by:
1. **Mode A (Transformed)**: Fruit of Spirit dominant - positive, healing words
2. **Mode B (Base)**: Normal state - mixed vocabulary showing tension
3. **Mode C (Rebellion)**: Works of Flesh amplified - darker vocabulary
4. **Neutral Core**: Universal words that work in any mode

Word pools are designed to:
- Create thematic word chains
- Influence puzzle difficulty through vocabulary complexity

## Word Chain Templates by Difficulty

### Easy (5-word chains)
- Use only 4-5 letter words
- Prefer common vocabulary
- Keep associations obvious

**Template**: [NOUN] -> [ADJECTIVE] -> [NOUN] -> [VERB] -> [RESULT]
**Example**: TREE -> GREEN -> LEAF -> FALL -> GROUND

### Medium (7-word chains)
- Mix 4-7 letter words
- Include some thematic vocabulary
- Associations require thought

**Template**: [CONCEPT] -> [EXAMPLE] -> [FEATURE] -> [OPPOSITE] -> [BRIDGE] -> [NEW CONCEPT] -> [CONCLUSION]
**Example**: PEACE -> QUIET -> STILL -> MOVE -> WALK -> PATH -> HOME

### Hard (11-word chains)
- Include 6-8 letter words
- Heavy thematic vocabulary
- Associations require cultural knowledge

**Template**: [THEME] -> [ASPECT] -> [DETAIL] -> [COMPLICATION] -> [PIVOT] -> [NEW DIRECTION] -> [DEVELOPMENT] -> [CLIMAX] -> [RESOLUTION] -> [AFTERMATH] -> [MEANING]
**Example (Gilead Mode B)**: WAIT -> PATIENT -> TIME -> LONG -> BURN -> RAGE -> EXPLODE -> DESTROY -> ASH -> NOTHING -> PEACE

---

## Implementation Notes

### Word Selection Algorithm

```
1. Identify current nation and mode
2. Select primary pool (Mode A/B/C)
3. Mix with neutral core (20-30% neutral words)
4. Apply difficulty filter (word length, complexity)
5. Ensure chain coherence (associations make sense)
6. Validate against forbidden concepts (see Language Tenets)
```

### Dynamic Mode Shifts

During gameplay, as the world state changes:
- Nation transforms: Shift from Mode B pool to Mode A pool
- Nation rebels: Shift from Mode B pool to Mode C pool
- Gradual transition: Mix pools during transition phases

### NPC Dialogue Integration

When NPCs speak:
1. Select vocabulary from current mode pool
2. Apply national grammatical markers (see main document)
3. Adjust phonetic choices based on mode
4. Include 1-2 unique cultural words per dialogue
