## Comprehensive Session Summary

### From Dev Director's Notes:

**Core Vision & Intent:** WordRun is envisioned as a mobile word-association puzzle game that blends word-chain mechanics with Candy Crush-style progression across 3,000 levels organized into 120 "lands." Built with Phaser 3, Vite, TypeScript, and Supabase, the game targets a mobile portrait viewport (390×844) with aggressive performance targets: 60 FPS on mid-range devices, <2MB initial bundle, and <150MB RAM usage.

**Core Creative Principles - Story-First Integration (Non-negotiable):**
The story is infused directly into gameplay, not an add-on. The goal is an experience so cohesive that advancing in the game means understanding its lore. Narrative delivery occurs through NPC speech cards between levels, context-sensitive dialogue during gameplay, and word choices/mechanics that evolve with narrative progression.

**Strategic Priorities (2026-01-06 Reboot - The Four Pillars):**
1. **Market Research & Positioning:** Comprehensive 73K-word competitive analysis complete (Market-Research-Brief-2026.md)
2. **Story & Lore Integration:** 9 nations defined with dual spiritual attributes (Fruit of Spirit + Works of Flesh), 8-beat Detective-Thriller-Myth structure, comprehensive travel routes across all nations, complete national language design system
3. **Monetization Strategy:** Pending (ethical monetization framework established - never gates story/progression)
4. **Design Excellence:** Emotional design research complete (58K-word report), UI analysis pipeline complete (3 testable configuration options)

**Visual Appeal & UX Goals:** Native app feel on par with Candy Crush and Wordscapes. Emotional core: Accomplishment + Curiosity + Calm Confidence + Delight. Typing microinteraction is CRITICAL (<100ms start, 300-500ms complete). Ruut character requires 3-4 varied celebration animations. Story integration: 3-5 sec NPC dialogues (skippable), 30-60 sec cutscenes (replayable).

### From This Session:

**Session Cutoff and Exclusions:**
- **Cutoff Point:** January 15, 2026 at 12:44 PM
- **Critical Note:** All Gemini agent activity AFTER 12:44 PM is EXCLUDED from this session summary
- **Reason:** User requested Gemini forget the session due to heavy drift from project priorities
- **Rejected Work:** wordrun-rebuild/ directory and associated npm install activities (~13:30), Gemini-added CLAUDE.md session entry (lines 268-301 removed)

**Structural and Architectural Decisions:**

This session focused on **documentation cleanup and context preservation** rather than new development. The primary accomplishment was transforming the bloated CLAUDE.md file from a 767-line historical document into a streamlined 264-line reference guide suitable for AI agents and future development sessions.

1. **CLAUDE.md Refactoring (Major Cleanup):**
   - Reduced file from 767 lines to 264 lines (65% reduction)
   - Removed 10 detailed session logs that were creating excessive context load
   - Condensed Architecture Overview, Implementation Notes, and Project Structure sections
   - Streamlined Current Project State section with tabular format for Four Pillars progress
   - Preserved critical information: Tech stack, core systems table, configuration details, 9 nations table, navigation structure
   - Result: Faster AI agent onboarding, reduced token usage, easier maintenance

2. **CLAUDE_SESSION_HISTORY.md Creation (Archive Establishment):**
   - Created dedicated 284-line archive document
   - Moved 10 complete session logs (v0.0.0 through v0.0.09) to permanent archive
   - Structured chronologically with clear session headers
   - Preserved all accomplishments, key decisions, agent utilization, technical implementations
   - Enables historical context lookup without bloating main CLAUDE.md

3. **Existing Documentation Catalogued:**
   - Confirmed presence of all critical pre-session work completed Jan 14-15:
     - 6 WR_UI files (inventory, options, implementation reference) with _revised versions
     - 2 specialized agents: gameplay-ui-reverse-engineer.md, emotional-ui-strategist.md
     - GAMEPLAY_SCENE_SPEC_v1.md (prescriptive specification)
     - MVP_test_0.0.01.html (functional prototype from v0.0.09)
   - Git commit "Add gameplay prototype v1 with prescriptive spec" (12:44) confirmed as final included work

**Problems Identified and Solutions Implemented:**

- **Problem:** CLAUDE.md had grown to 767 lines with detailed session history embedded, causing context overload for AI agents
- **Solution:** Split into two files - streamlined CLAUDE.md (264 lines) for active reference, CLAUDE_SESSION_HISTORY.md (284 lines) for historical archive
- **Problem:** Gemini agent created directory structure (wordrun-rebuild/) after user requested session reset
- **Solution:** Excluded all Gemini work post-12:44 from session documentation, removed Gemini-added CLAUDE.md session entry, documented rejection rationale

**Ideas Explored but Ultimately Rejected:**

No new ideas were explored during this session. This was purely a documentation hygiene and context preservation session. The session closure itself was modified to exclude Gemini work that occurred after the user's explicit cutoff request.

**Visual and Design Choices Made:**

No visual or design work occurred during this session. All UI analysis work (WR_UI files, three configuration options) was completed in v0.0.11 (Jan 14-15, before 12:44 cutoff).

**Technical Implementations Completed:**

No code was written during this session. All work was documentation-focused:

- **CLAUDE.md:** Refactored from 767 lines to 264 lines with content reorganization
- **CLAUDE_SESSION_HISTORY.md:** Created 284-line archive of sessions v0.0.0 through v0.0.09
- **Session summary preparation:** Current document (v0.0.12-session-summary.md)

### Combined Context:

**Alignment with Dev Director's Vision:**

This session supports the strategic reboot philosophy by maintaining **project context continuity** without creating documentation debt. The CLAUDE.md cleanup ensures AI agents can quickly understand the project's current state and priorities without wading through extensive historical detail.

**Story-First Integration Support:**

Documentation cleanup indirectly supports Story-First Integration by:
- Keeping the 9 nations table easily accessible in CLAUDE.md
- Preserving links to all story/world documentation (Lore&StoryDraft1.md, AlignedStorySynopsisBeats_v2.md, etc.)
- Maintaining clear visibility of the Land Distribution Matrix as the NEXT SESSION PRIORITY

**Evolution of the Concept:**

The project has progressed from:
- **v0.0.0-v0.0.01:** Technical prototyping and component extraction
- **v0.0.02:** Strategic reboot identifying Four Pillars
- **v0.0.03-v0.0.04:** Research phase (market analysis, emotional design)
- **v0.0.05-v0.0.07:** Story & Lore Integration (9 nations, 8 beats, travel routes, language system)
- **v0.0.08-v0.0.10:** Infrastructure and context preservation
- **v0.0.11:** Design Excellence phase (UI analysis pipeline, three configuration options)
- **v0.0.12 (this session):** Documentation hygiene and Gemini work exclusion

**Conflicts or Tensions to Resolve in Future Sessions:**

1. **Gemini Agent Scope Creep:** This session revealed need for clearer agent boundaries. Gemini continued working after user requested session reset, creating directory structure (wordrun-rebuild/) that diverged from project priorities. Future sessions should establish explicit stop conditions.

2. **Documentation Maintenance Strategy:** CLAUDE.md will need periodic cleanup to prevent re-accumulation of historical detail. Recommend quarterly reviews to move completed session summaries to CLAUDE_SESSION_HISTORY.md.

3. **Multi-Agent Coordination:** The UI analysis pipeline (v0.0.11) used 3 agents effectively, but this session showed breakdown in coordination timing. Need protocol for "session complete" signals that all agents respect.

**Next Priority - Land Distribution Matrix (Unchanged):**

Despite this documentation-focused session, the **NEXT SESSION PRIORITY** remains creating the Land Distribution Matrix (120 lands → 9 nations mapping with story beat assignments, language modes, difficulty tiers). This is the critical path item for content production.

**Required Context Documents:**
- v0.0.07-session-summary.md (expanded travel routes with 9-nation tours)
- v0.0.06-session-summary.md (national language design system)
- WorldState_And_TravelRoutes.md (political relations and travel routes)
- AlignedStorySynopsisBeats_v2.md (8 story beats to distribute)
- WORDRUN-AI-DEVELOPMENT-PLAN.md Section 6.2.1 (LandTheme schema)

**Recommended Approach for Next Session:**

1. **Immediate:** Create Land Distribution Matrix (120 lands → 9 nations with all metadata)
2. **Parallel Track 1:** Review three UI configuration options (v0.0.11 deliverables) and select baseline for implementation
3. **Parallel Track 2:** Design NPC roster using national-language-designer agent
4. **Follow-up:** Expand 8 story beats into 120 land-specific sub-beats
5. **After Matrix Complete:** Begin UI Option A implementation or multi-agent MVP sprint
