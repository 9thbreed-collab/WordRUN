# AI Animation Prompts: Idle Animations

This document contains a structured list of prompts for generating various character idle animations using an AI video generator.

## Base Prompt (For Isometric View)

This is the foundational prompt to define the scene, camera, and style. Append one of the specific animation prompts below to it.

> An animation of the character from the provided image.
>
> **Camera:** Use a static, high-angle isometric camera, like in a mobile decorating game. The camera must not move.
>
> **Scene:** Simple, neutral, non-moving background.
>
> **Style:** Maintain exact character proportions without morphing. The character's feet must remain planted in place unless the specific animation requires them to move. Ensure clean outlines and no motion blur.

## Animation Prompts

### 1. Standard & Subtle Idles

*   **Breathing Idle (Looping):**
    > **Animation:** A seamless, looping idle animation. The character breathes gently, causing a subtle rise and fall of their chest and shoulders. The motion should be calm, minimal, and relaxed.

*   **Look Around (Looping):**
    > **Animation:** A seamless, looping idle animation. The character shifts their weight slightly while looking curiously to the left, then to the right, before returning to face forward.

### 2. Waving Idles

*   **Wave Forward (Non-Looping):**
    > **Animation:** The character, oriented at a 3/4 angle, lifts a hand and gives a friendly wave in the direction they are already facing.

*   **Wave at Camera (Non-Looping):**
    > **Animation:** The character, oriented at a 3/4 angle, turns their head to look directly at the camera and gives a friendly wave *to the camera*. Their feet do not move from their spot.

### 3. Cute & Whimsical Idles

*   **The Butterfly (Non-Looping):**
    > **Animation:** A sequence:
    > 1. A small, glowing butterfly appears and flutters around the character's head.
    > 2. The character watches it with curiosity.
    > 3. The butterfly briefly lands on the character's nose.
    > 4. The character's eyes go slightly crossed as they look at it.
    > 5. The butterfly flies away.

*   **Happy Hop (Looping):**
    > **Animation:** A seamless, looping idle animation. The character performs a single, small, happy hop, kicking their heels up slightly before landing softly in the exact same spot.

### 4. Fourth-Wall-Breaking & Silly Idles

*   **Screen Tap (Non-Looping):**
    > **Animation:** The character looks directly at the camera, walks up to the "screen," and gently taps on it as if it's glass. After a brief pause, they walk back to their original position.

*   **Dizzy Spell (Looping):**
    > **Animation:** A seamless, looping idle animation. The character spins around once quickly, then stops, looking dizzy for a moment with circling stars around their head before shaking it off and returning to normal.

### 5. Suggested Bonus Idles

*   **Sleepy Yawn (Non-Looping):**
    > **Animation:** The character does a big, exaggerated, sleepy yawn and stretches their arms out wide before settling back into their idle pose.

*   **Magical Flower (Non-Looping):**
    > **Animation:** The character looks at the ground, and a small, magical flower sprouts rapidly from the floor in front of them. They look at it with wonder before it vanishes in a puff of sparkles.

*   **Pocket Search (Non-Looping):**
    > **Animation:** The character pats their pockets as if searching for something, pulls out a small, glowing object (like a key or a gem), looks at it, and then puts it back in their pocket.
